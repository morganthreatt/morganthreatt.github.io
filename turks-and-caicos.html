      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Turks and Caicos Islands were discovered first in 1512 by europeans. Since then the islands have always been claimed by european powers and eventually the Brittish empire took control of the islands, that is where the history begins.</p>

      <p>Turks and Caicos Islands were apart of the United Kingdoms's Jamaican colony for a while, until Jamaica assumed it's own status as an independent colony.</p>

      <p>The Islands were also associated with the Bahamas. The governor of the Bahamas ran Turks and Caicos Islands and their affairs for eight years from 1965 until 1973. When the Bahamas became indepent, Turks and Caicos Islands then had to recieve new leadership in 1973, a completely new governor.</p>

      <p>Turks and Caicos islands became indepent in 1982, however since polocies have changed since then the Islands are still considered Brittish overseen territory.</p>

      <p>In 2009 the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> took away the power Turks and Caicos Islands had to self govern due to allegations of corruption. In 2012 power was restored, still to be overseen by the United Kingdom.</p>
